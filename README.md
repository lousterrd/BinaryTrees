# BinaryTrees
Creating binary trees and binary search trees and going through preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.


I utilized c++14 in order to allow auto return types, because c++11 was giving me errors.

I first traverse the tree Inorder, then in Preorder, and finally in Postorder. 

Then the height of the tree is displayed by using the getHeight method.
